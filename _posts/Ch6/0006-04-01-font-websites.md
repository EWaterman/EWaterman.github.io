Here’s a list of sites where you can get digital fonts from. Make sure to check the licensing before using a font commercially!

[Blambot](http://www.blambot.com/fonts_index.shtml) - Tons of fonts for dialogue and SFX, all designed for comics. This is where I got my fonts for More Than Men.

[1001 Fonts](http://www.1001fonts.com/) - A LOT of fonts (hence the name) though there isn’t a filter for comic specific ones.

[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/classification/comic) - Mostly general fonts though they have decent collection of comic specific fonts.

[Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/) - Turn your handwriting into a font!
