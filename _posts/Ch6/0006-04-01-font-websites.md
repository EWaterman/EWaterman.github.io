Here’s a list of sites where you can get digital fonts from. Make sure to check the licensing before using a font commercially!

[Blambot](http://www.blambot.com/fonts_index.shtml) - Tons of fonts for dialogue and SFX, all designed for comics. This is where I got my fonts for More Than Men.

[Comicraft](http://www.comicbookfonts.com/) - Lots of comic specific fonts. They’re not cheap but a lot of them look pretty good.

[Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/) - Turn your handwriting into a font!
