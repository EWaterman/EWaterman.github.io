Surprisingly (or maybe not), not only are there different fonts to choose from, there are also quite a few font TYPES to be aware of. As a quick overview:

#### Type1

- One of the original digital font types so it has limited features

- Low number of allowed characters/glyphs

- Still universally supported, though it’s been widely replaced by OpenType 

#### [TrueType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType)

- “Standard” font type with all the base features.

- NOT cross platform (requires converting your font files to switch between windows and mac)

#### [OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType)

- Extended from TrueType and Type1 (so has all their features and more)

- Platform agnostic (works on both windows and mac interchangeably)

- Auto-ligature support

#### AdobeType

- I don’t know much about this one but you can read about it on Adobe’s FAQ page.

To keep it simple, if given a choice **choose OpenType**.
