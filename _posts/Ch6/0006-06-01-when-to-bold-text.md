This is a point of contention among creators so I decided to break it out into it’s own section. 

**Some letterers believe bolding should be used to emphasize key points in dialogue.** The idea is that you should be able to read just the bolded points and still get a clear understanding of what’s going on.

“Have you been **outside** today? The **weather** has been crazy. So **hot**. By the way, **Jim** is **dead**.”

That’s an exaggeration but you get the idea. If you noticed, I use this technique with the guide.

The problem with this style is that it often breaks the natural reading flow of the text. Because of this, **some letterers believe that bolding should be reserved for emphasis in speech**.

“SHUT UP TOMMY!”

“NO **YOU** SHUT UP!”

Personally I tend to agree with the second group since I find the excessive use of bolding gets obnoxious after a while. It’s a bit like putting commas, everywhere, in your, dialogue. That said, if you’re going for a classic comic feel you might want to consider that first approach.
