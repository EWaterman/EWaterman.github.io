I mentioned this briefly in the section on colouring but I think it’s especially important when it comes to lettering.

To summarize again, there are two ways to create black with CMYK colouring:

- **Standard blacks** use only K values while setting CMY values to zero.
- **Rich blacks** add CMY values to your blacks. Rich blacks result in a more absolute black when going to print.

In colouring, it’s almost always prefered to use rich blacks over standard ones but in lettering this is not the case.

In printing, each source colour (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) require a different printing plate. This means the number of source colours you use in each section of a page will determine the number of plates required to print that section.

Because rich blacks use all four colours, they require all four printing plates (CMYK) to be used. If a slight shifting in the plates occurs, those rich blacks can become blurred on the page. This effect is more noticeable in lettering since the lines are so slim so any shifting effects are more amplified.

By using standard blacks this effect can be avoided since they only use a single printing plate (K).

Because of this, **I recommend sticking to standard blacks** (C=0, Y=0, M=0, K=100) **when lettering.**

This is not a fully agreed upon topic however. Many letterers do choose to use rich blacks in their work to get a more pure colour out of their letters.

Ultimately the magnitude of the shifting effect depends on the printer you use so make sure to talk to them about it before going to print.
