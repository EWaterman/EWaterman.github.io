Han Solo, Batman, Forrest Gump… Everyone has their favourite. 

**Characters are the lifeblood of your story.** Without strong, likable characters there is very little chance your readers will be interested in your comic.

That is not an exaggeration. I truly believe that **this is the single most important step when writing your story**. If I had to choose just one thing to go right in my story, I’d want it to have good characters.

So listen up!

So you want to make amazing characters. Good! Here are some quick tips on how to do that:

#### Make your characters relatable.

- **Give your characters flaws and force them to confront them.** Writers are often warned not to create [Mary Sue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue) characters. This is because perfection is not relatable. Humans are flawed creatures and we naturally identify with those who have similar problems. A character’s struggle to overcome their flaws makes us want to root for them.

- **Giving a character moments of genuinity makes them feel more real to us.** Everyone has an opinion. What are your characters passionate about? Once you know that, ask yourself...
 
- **How does your character express their passions to the outside world?** Maybe they’re very intimate and personal with them, hiding their true selves to all but their closest friends. Maybe they have nothing to hide and will express themselves freely in front of anyone.

- **Consider showing your characters in a vulnerable state.** Vulnerability generates sympathy. If you have a character who never reveals their emotions, when you finally have them break down in a moment of weakness, the reader will immediately become attached.

- **If you show your characters matter to each other, they’ll matter to the reader.** The exception to this is to have a character who is explicitly outcast from the rest of the world.

#### Make your characters interesting.

- **Avoid flat characters.** People are more complex than just a single personality quirk. The jock, the nerd, the dumb blond. If your characters can boil down just to these traits, you don’t have characters, you have a collection of stereotypes. Of course, this can be done intentionally for comedic purposes.

- **Characters should be aspiring to something.** What is the one thing your character really wants? Give your character one or more goals and then give them flaws that hinder their progress towards those goals.

- You generally want to **avoid passive characters**. These are characters who have stuff happen to them as opposed to ones who take action. You want your characters to drive the plot for themselves. Have them do something that has lasting effects on your story.

- **Characters can have multiple desires that may conflict with each other.** Maybe your character wants to go out and explore the world but they would have to leave the family they love behind. Internal conflicts are just as important as external ones. 

#### Make your characters feel natural.

- **Have your characters behave in a consistent way.** If one of your characters is an impatient jerk in one scene then suddenly starts behaving like a posh Englishman, your readers will be confused. Give your characters a specific attitude and way of talking. They can still act differently around different people and when they’re in different moods but there should still have a consistent undertone throughout the story.

- **Give your characters a clear, traceable arc.** This is a big one. It falls back onto my previous idea that you should treat characters as a kind of plot arch in themselves. How are they at the start of the story and is who they become at the end satisfying?

So I’ve given you a bunch of tips but how do you make sure you’re following them?

**Write a character bio.** This is just a place where you’ll write down the key information of your characters. It’s something you can refer back to when your character comes up in a scene and it’s a nice way to keep them consistent throughout your story.

In my character bios, I include things like appearance, personal history, personality quirks, flaws and main motivations. I like to keep things simple but your bio can contain absolutely anything you feel is relevant to the story. If you want to flesh your characters out even more, here are a few things you can do:

- **Interview your characters.** Check out this [list of 100 questions](http://www.miniworld.com/adnd/100ThingsAboutUrPCBackGround.html) (Beth Kinderman and Nikki Walker) to ask your characters.

- **Take a personality test for your characters.** Answer as if your character was being asked the questions and see if they fall into a specific category. [This one](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) is my favourite and it takes less than ten minutes.

Some people think the names of your characters don’t really matter but they actually have more impact than you may believe. Here are some tips to make sure your characters names have the right kind of impact:

- **It’s generally a good idea to make character names easy to pronounce.** You can test this by reading the name out loud. Nghzz’aa Bkl’epp may seem cool at first but your reader isn’t going to want to read that a hundred times.

- **Make sure there aren’t multiple ways to pronounce a given name.** Hermione could be read as both “her-my-o-nee” and “her-me-own”. This is a bad choice in my opinion as it ends up confusing your readers.

- **Using alliteration in a name makes the character stand out.** Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Peter Parker, Reed Richards, Severus Snape. Be careful with this one. There’s a fine line between memorable and cheesy.

- **Harsh sounds like “v”, “ch”, “ck”, “d” and “x” make for a meaner sounding character.** Softer, more flowy sounds have the opposite effect. Neville Longbottom vs Darth Vader.

- **Make sure your name is appropriate for the time period of your story and the ethnic background of your character.** Naming a modern day character Mildred will make the character seem like they don’t fit into your world (this can be done intentionally!). Google is your friend!

- **Consider naming a character based on the symbolism behind the name.** This adds depth to your character and creates a cool easter egg for your readers. [Behind the Name](https://www.behindthename.com/) is a cool site that provides the etymology and history of first names.

A quick Wikipedia search for my name gives the following:

> Evan comes from Gaelic Eóghan meaning "youth" or "young warrior" and Scots for "right-handed". In Hebrew, the actual non-proper noun, "evan / even / eban / eben", literally means "rock". It can also be the shortened version of the Greek name "Evangelos" (meaning messenger, or "Evander" (meaning good man). The old English translation of the name "Evan" could also be interpreted as "Heir of the Earth" or "The King"

- If you’re stuck you can **combine two ordinary names together to create a unique one.** For example, Cole + Brendan = Brolen.

- **Don’t have multiple characters names start with the same letter.** Naming your main characters David, Dan and Daryll will be confusing to your readers. That said, this could be used intentionally for [comedic purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed,_Edd_n_Eddy).
