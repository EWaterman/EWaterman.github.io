*What if only the rich had super powers?*

That was the idea that sparked my entire story. Everything I wrote in More Than Men is a follow up to that question.

**No matter how grand or how epic, every story is sparked from a single idea.**

Go find that one thing (or many things) that you just can’t get out of your head and turn it into something awesome!

> But I don’t HAVE any ideas yet!

Well...

### Finding Your Idea

Writers often have tons of ideas bouncing around in their heads but here are a few quick tips if you’re struggling to come up with something:

- **Go out and explore.** Walk the streets, go for a hike in nature, whatever. Just get yourself out of your regular environment.

- **Find out what’s trending right now in social media.** The internet is always buzzing with interesting stories, scientific discoveries and LOTS of drama.

- **Watch the news.** Like social media, the news is a great source of random world events. This is especially useful if your story has political elements.

- **Read writing prompts.** Prompts are a quick and easy way to get the creative juices flowing. There are [tons of sites](http://www.writersdigest.com/prompts) that will provide these prompts.

- **Read other stories.** There’s nothing wrong with drawing inspiration from other works. Some if not all of the best movies out there have heavy influences. Just remember to make things your own. Plagiarism is a no no.

- **Write what you know.** If you’re knowledgeable on a topic, odds are you’ll have a lot you can say about it. Use your story as a chance to share your intelligence with your readers or express it in a cool way.

- **Write what you don’t know, but want to.** Yes I know I just said to write what you know but if you’re curious about something, writing about it is often a great way to learn. It forces you to research a topic and having that curiosity will only help motivate you further.

- **Think about the things that YOU care about.** What are your passions? What are the things that occupy your thoughts and keep you up at night? Everyone is interested in something, and by writing about something you care about will help make your stories more genuine and more fun to write.

### How Awesome Is My Idea?

<hr><br>
Okay so you have your first idea for a story. A few good ways to tell if your idea is a good one are if:

- **It’s unique.** By creating a story that people have never read before, you’ll be able to immediately hook them in. There are so many cookie cutter plot movies out there. If you diverge in just a single aspect, whether it be plot, characters or setting, your story is more likely to be noticed. Think Guardians of the Galaxy and the Deadpool movies. Still really mainstream films but everyone loved them because they put a twist on their genre.

- **It gives you a whole bunch of follow up ideas.** No matter how good an one idea is, if you can’t create an entire story around it it’s just not worth it. A lot of movies have this one moment in them that is clearly identifiable as the reason the film got made. If that moment doesn’t mesh with the rest of the narrative, the story just feels forced. Your main ideas should spawn a whole bunch of other ideas for your story to feed off of. Every single male on earth dies? Now THAT has a lot of potential to be explored in more detail.

- **It’s cool.** This one speaks for itself. Coolness sells. If an idea just sounds fun to you, odds are people will find it fun too. A magic system that’s directly powered by colours? Cool! A lot of action scenes fall into this category. Think about Legolas taking down the Oliphaunt or Arnold Schwarzenegger fighting the predator. It’s big, it’s dumb, it’s awesome.
