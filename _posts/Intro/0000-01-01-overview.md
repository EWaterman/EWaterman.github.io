Hey there! Welcome to the guide :)

First off I want to say that **everything in this guide is just an expression of my opinion**. If you disagree with how something should be done, I encourage you to do it your own way.

Everyone has their own processes so when in doubt, go with what feels best for you. I just wanted to share what’s worked for me in the hopes of helping you succeed in your comic making adventures.

Secondly, as much as I wish it was, this guide is NOT comprehensive. I’m still constantly updating it with new information that I come across. If you have any additional resources that you find helpful, please don’t hesitate to share in the comment section below and I’ll add them in.

Third, and probably most importantly, **every tip I specify has it’s exceptions**. Standards exist because they are proven to work in most but not all cases. When it comes to subjective mediums like comics, there is no rule (that I can think of) which applies 100% of the time.

**The key is knowing WHEN to break the rules.** Doing something non-standard for the sake of it hardly ever works in the creator’s favour so make sure to have a reason for not following the template.

### How The Guide Is Structured

<hr><br>
The purpose of this guide is to help walk you through every major step of creating a comic. Each step is broken down into chapters. Chapters are placed in the rough order that you’ll be working. That said, I’d advise you to read into future chapters before you start your comic as some lessons will apply to previous ones.
