First off I want to say that everything in this guide is just an expression of my opinion. If you disagree with how something should be done, by all means do it your own way. Everyone has their own processes so when in doubt, go with what feels best for you. I just wanted to share what’s worked for me in the hopes of helping others succeed in their comic making adventures.

Secondly, as much as I wish it was, this guide is NOT comprehensive. I’m still constantly updating it with new information that I come across. If you have any additional resources that you find helpful, please don’t hesitate to share in the comment section below and I’ll add them in.
