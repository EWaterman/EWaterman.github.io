I don’t like self promotion so I’ll make this short but I thought it would be a good idea to be transparent and share a bit about myself.

My name is Evan Waterman. I’m a software developer living in Vancouver, Canada. I also write and letter comics.

I don’t have years of experience in the industry nor any work with a big publisher. What I do have though is a fiery passion for comics. I’ve spent countless hours researching and honing my skills in the hopes of becoming the best creator I can be. As I continue to learn, I plan on sharing my knowledge with all of you so that we can grow together, both as an industry and as a community.

If you want to check out my work or just chat comics you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Evan_Waterman).

### Why Make This Guide?

<hr><br>
To keeps things simple, I love comics. I love reading people’s stories and I love finding ways to express myself through my own stories. What truly excites me about comics though is that for all the years they’ve been around, it’s still a generally unexplored medium. We’ve barely cracked the surface of what can be achieved with comics and I think it’s amazing to see how people discover new, awesome ways to express themselves through them.

That said, making comics is hard. There’s a lot that goes into them and tons to know if you want to do them well.

That’s why I made this guide. I love stories but they’re nothing without the creators behind them. If I don’t support my fellow creators there won't BE a comics industry. I truly believe that if our society is to survive, we can’t afford to be in constant competition. We NEED to work together. By sharing guides like this one, I hope to not only help you learn and grow but to also inspire you to share your knowledge with the world (and me) to help others grow as well.

Comics is not a zero sum game. Your gain is my gain so why not help each other out? We’re all on the same team after all :)

Alright, let’s get right into it. I hope you have fun!
