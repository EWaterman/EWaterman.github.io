I don’t like self promoting so I’ll make this short but I thought it would be a good idea to be transparent and share a bit about myself.

My name is Evan Waterman. I’m a software developer living in Vancouver, Canada. I also write and letter comics.

I don’t have years of experience in the industry nor any work with a big publisher. What I do have though is a fiery passion for comics. I’ve spent countless hours researching and honing my skills in the hopes of becoming the best creator I can be. As I continue to learn, I plan on sharing my knowledge with all of you so that we can grow together, both as an industry and as a community.

If you want to check out my work or just chat comics you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Evan_Waterman).
