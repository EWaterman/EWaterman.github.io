Comic printing can be really expensive and when self publishing it’s important to save money whenever you can. Here are some tips to save some cash without cutting corners in the process.

- **Request split binding when printing multiple cover types.** Split binding is when you reuse printing plates to print the same image on pages with different binding methods. This is great if you’re printing soft and hardcover copies of your book at the same time. Producing both together reuses plates and avoids duplicate work down the line.

- **Gang print your variant covers.** Gang printing is when you bundle multiple pages on the same printing plates to save space (offset printing only). This reduces the number of printing plates required, which is one of the most costly pieces of the process. Here’s a [30 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBWi7U9gBCg) on the topic. Sometimes a printer can even gang print your pages with other people’s pages if they have another order to fill. Each printer handles gang printing differently (and some don’t do it at all) so make sure to talk to them all individually.

- **Print your projects at the same time.** If you bundle projects together, some printers will offer you a bulk discount (you can potentially take advantage of gang printing here too). This will also most likely end up saving you money in shipping costs. Alternatively, approach a printer with a friend and see if you can get a discount that way. As always, talk to your printer and be nice!

- **Look around for promotional deals.** Many podcasts and YouTube channels are partnered with printing companies and can net you a discount on your purchase.

- **Get quotes from as many printers as possible.** Prices can vary wildly from printer to printer and from job to job. A printer may be able to print your project for cheap but will cost a lot for someone else. There’s no harm in getting an estimate, you might be pleasantly surprised. Additionally, many printers will price match if you share estimates from other printers. It’s also nice to have backups in case a deal falls through. Play it smart and don’t go with a printer until you compare it with others.

- **Get quotes for different numbers of copies.** For every printer you contact, find the price to print different numbers of books. I like to ask for estimates on 250, 500 and 1000 prints. It’s always going to be cheaper to print 500 copies once than it is to print 250 copies twice. That said, it’s really hard to predict the number of copies you’ll actually need. Check out the later section for more details. Now, I don’t ever expect to need 1000 copies of my book but it’s nice to have an estimate just in case something crazy happens. You never know!
