Gang printing, trim zones, plate signatures, colour gamuts...

There are A LOT of technical terms to know when it comes to printing and it can seem a daunting task to try and understand it all (I know it was for me). Don’t worry though, I’ll be covering all the printing terms I’ve ever come across and by the end of this section, you’ll be a printing wiz!

Printing is a hugely important part of the comic making process and can be a massive money sink for creators. The tips I’m going to share with you will hopefully get you in the printer’s mindset and help you get the most bang for your buck.

As I always say, you may not be expecting to print your comic but **if you do the work ahead of time and make print-safe art, you’ll save yourself tons of trouble down the line** if you ever change your mind.
