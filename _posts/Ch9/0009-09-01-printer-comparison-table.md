[Prices To Print Your Comic](http://www.digitalwebbing.com/forums/showthread.php?t=170069) - Digital Webbing forums thread by Renae De Liz

Armed with the knowledge from the previous sections, it’s time to pick your printer!

**If you’re only printing in very small numbers** (25 or less) **your best option price wise is probably a local printer.** That would most likely entail some additional setup however since most local printers aren’t set up for comics.

**If you’re doing a major run** (250+ copies), **you’ll probably save money by going with a larger printer.**

To help you out I’ve amassed a list of printers with their estimates. I couldn't embed the table nicely in the webpage but you can check it out on google docs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mdNTBiC3UrBuoelf-tuUUWjCRUcIyp8KmGB_AWjaHPw/edit?usp=sharing).

All price estimates are in USD and are based off the specs for my personal comic which are:

- **32 pages** (not including cover)
- **Gloss coating** (interior pages and cover)
- **6.625 by 10.25 inch page size**
- **Full colour**
- **Saddle stitched**

Different specs can vary the prices quite a bit from company to company so don’t take these prices as a direct comparison for what to expect for your comic.
