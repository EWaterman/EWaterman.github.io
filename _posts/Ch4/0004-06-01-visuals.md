It’s the moment you’ve all be waiting for! It’s finally time for the actual art of your comic!

Well there’s a lot to cover here so strap yourself in and let’s get down to it.

- Whenever possible, **guide the reader’s eye to next panel**. Leading lines can help show the reader where to look next on the page. The direction characters are looking have a similar effect since we naturally want to look at things that other people are looking at. Some good examples of pages that do this well can be found [here](http://www.webcomicalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/10-batman2.jpg) and [here](http://www.webcomicalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/01Batroc-vs-Capn.jpg). This guidance can also be achieved through the use of focal points. Example [here](http://www.webcomicalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08-supermonkey.jpg).

- **Add more detail and higher contrast to emphasize focal points.** This will help these points stand out more and thus will draw our attention to them.

- **Focal points can also be established at the intersection of perpendicular lines.** When all the lines in a panel point to a single place (where the join up), the reader’s attention is immediately pulled to that spot.

- **Note that backgrounds are not required in every panel.** Background are useful for setting a scene but can sometimes clog up a panel and distract the reader. They also slow the pacing because they give the reader more to examine within the panel. For this reason, most action panels drop the background out completely. You can also drop out a background to add special emphasis to a big moment or a shocking reveal. Here’s [a fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbMj9f0mcBA) by Strip Panel Naked about background usage.

- **By varying line thickness and shading you can add depth to your panels.** Thicker lines and heavier shading are often used for elements in the foreground of a panel. This is done to draw or hide focus of these elements.

- **Avoid tangent lines in your drawings.** These make objects feel connected or flat when they shouldn’t be. Some good examples can be found [here](https://schweizercomics.tumblr.com/post/11966164633/the-schweizer-guide-to-spotting-tangents) and [here](http://emptyeasel.com/2008/11/18/avoiding-tangents-9-visual-blunders-every-artist-should-watch-out-for/).

- **The direction your characters face matters.** Most likely as a consequence of the western world’s influence, we as a society have unconsciously created a meaning behind directions.

    - **Moving left to right means progress.** Because of this, those on the left side are perceived as weaker than those on the right. Characters on the right are seen to be hindering the progress of those on the left.
    
    - **Moving back to front means and increase in power.** This is because the character moving to the front would be taking up more space in the panel and thus are seen as more important.
    
    - **Angling up at someone makes them look powerful.** Looking down on a character has the opposite effect.
    
    - Similarly, **a level shot on a character makes them more relatable**. This is because they’re shown on equal ground to the reader. A level shot can also makes a scene feel more ordinary or grounded in the real world.

- **Follow the [180 degree rule](http://www.floobynooby.com/IPUB/axislines.png).** This is to keep characters on the same side of the panel throughout a scene. There are two reasons we want to do this. First, it makes the scene easier to follow for the reader. Second, it establishes and maintains the power dynamics between characters in your scene. (See the previous point on direction.) If you want to break this dynamic, the 180 degree rule can be maintained by clearly establishing a new line through character or camera movement. Here’s [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4KFM_CLoQ0) demonstrating the point.

- **Avoid parallel lines in your art.** Using varied angles makes your characters feel more lively. (Some examples [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a0/72/62/a07262d07e4a062025f32cdd898375ca.jpg) and [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5e/1e/b7/5e1eb73268592a0ea8c32908afdad77e.jpg).) The same can be said about objects and scenery.

- **Avoid putting two focus points too close together.** The points will be competing for the reader’s attention resulting in a confusing experience.

- **Know how body language reflects how your characters and how your readers perceive them.** [This photo](http://www.floobynooby.com/boards/bl.png) is absolutely amazing and conveys everything I could think of regarding body language.

- **Absolutely everything [this picture](http://www.floobynooby.com/IPUB/Twinning.jpg) says about character poses.**

- **Remember the [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds).**

- **The amount of space a character takes up in a panel reflects their power. Two people evenly spaced in a shot shows us they’re in balance. If one character takes up a majority of the panel, forcing the other up against the border, we can infer that this character is somehow stronger than the other.

- **When doing shot, reverse shot, keep the camera in the middle of the two characters to keep a natural feel.** Over the shoulder shots can sometimes make us feel like we’re spying on the characters.
