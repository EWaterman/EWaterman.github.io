When designing thumbnails, your first focus should be page composition: how the panels fit together on the page.

Here are some tips to make sure your page layout is fully optimized:

- **Make sure your panels have a natural reading order.** People read in “Z” order (left to right, top to bottom). If you disrupt that order without properly guiding the reader you risk [throwing off the flow](https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/833/posts/24179/image/comic-reading-order.png) of your page. [Here’s the result](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Hyfo1pWUp0/VQHQo8k_75I/AAAAAAAADF8/sYce3LHtS5s/s1600/nc2_blockage.jpg) of an actual study to reflect this point.

- **Use smaller gutters in between panels that are read together.** This one is hard to explain so just check out [this picture](http://forums.tapastic.com/uploads/default/37303/e6dae951b3756f21.jpg). Notice how the first three panels share small gutters? Larger gutters are used to split up the page into sections. This is so the reader doesn’t accidently move to the next tier before reading all the panels. Here’s [a more obvious example](http://comicsalliance.com/files/2011/08/akiratoriyama-dragonballz-02.jpg).

- Unless you’re going for a specific effect, or are pairing panels like the previous point states, **keep your gutters the same size throughout your pages**. This just makes it easier for the reader to get through your pages and know what panel comes next.

- **Pair setup and payoff in the same tier.** By keeping paired panels in the same tier, we maintain the rhythm between them. This point is key for comedy. This is why almost all gag comic that you see in newspapers are a single row. [Here’s a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2YTxTSn_qk) that covers this point.

- **Use large panels for establishing shots.** Big panels take longer to read because there’s more stuff in them. This is useful when changing scenes when you want to reset the pacing.

- On the flip side, **use more narrow panels to build tension**. Narrow panels pull the reader quickly through the page. This ramps up the pacing similar to how movies make lots of jump cuts in action scenes.

- **Borderless panels can be used as emphasis or to create a feeling of timelessness.** By bleeding a panel to the edges of a page, the reader gets the feeling that it continues beyond the page. This can be used to imply scale or to amplify an effect such as loneliness.
