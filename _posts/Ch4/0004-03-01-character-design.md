When designing characters you have a ton of factors to tweak. Things like race, body type, hair style, facial features and posture all play an important role in how readers will perceive your characters. 

- **Make each of your characters distinct.** Like I said before, there are many different features you can vary when creating characters. If all your characters are buff white dudes with brown hair and a goatee, your readers are 

- Once you've decided on their look, **make sure to draw your characters consistently**. While the clothes your characters wear may change, facial features do not. Even subtle slips in style can result in an unrecognizable character and consequently a confused reader. A lot of artists create [character/model design sheets](http://characterdesignnotes.blogspot.ca/2010/12/model-sheets-101.html) to help them draw characters consistently. These sheets involve a bunch of shots of their characters with many different positions, angles and facial/body expressions, providing a reference of the character for the artist.

### Character stereotypes and whether or not to use them

<hr><br>
Regardless of their truth, our society has grown to associate certain looks with certain personality types. Someone who stands tall is confident. A guy with scrawny arms and big glasses is a nerd. A girl with short hair and piercings is a rebel and probably gay. If and how you choose to take advantage of these stereotypes is up to you but there are a few options you can take:

The first and easiest choice is to **give your characters a look that matches how you want your reader to feel about them**. Big and strong characters come off as angry and intimidating. If someone dresses quirky, we see them as outsiders or “different”. Features like this are immediately recognizable and can quickly help establish a character.

There are drawbacks to this approach however. Since these ideas all stem from well known stereotypes, they can lead to boring, predictable or even straight up insensitive and discriminatory looking characters.

Another option is to flip the stereotype on its head and **give your characters the look that matches least with their personality**. The burly pacifist. The aggressive short man. These looks reverse our expectations and are often used for comedic purposes. They can also be used as internal conflicts for your characters, having the world perceive them a certain way when really it isn't true.

Personally, I would encourage you to try to **break stereotypes with your characters**. Not every woman with short hair is gay after all. Similarly, I encourage you to **avoid the default look**. Not every woman needs to be in perfect physical shape with long legs and gorgeous features. People come in all shapes and sizes and while it may take some tweaking in your style, avoiding the default look makes your characters more unique and can add a lot of depth to your story.
