When designing characters you have a few options.

The easy route is to **give your characters a look that matches how you want your reader to feel about them**. Big and strong characters come off as angry and intimidating. Characters with scrawny arms and big glasses seem nerdy. If someone dresses quirky, we see them as outsiders or “different”.

Personally, I would encourage you to **break stereotypes with your characters**. Just because someone is gay doesn’t mean they should have the “gay look”. While it may take some adjusting to by your readers, avoiding the default look makes your story more unique and can add a lot of depth to your characters. 

Another option is to flip the stereotype on its head and **give your characters the look that matches least with their personality**. The burly pacifist, the aggressive short man. These looks reverse our expectations and are often used for comedic purposes. They can also be used as internal conflicts for your characters.
