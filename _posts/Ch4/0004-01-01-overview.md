<hr><br>
While this chapter is all about drawing for comics, **I am NOT going to teach you how to draw**. That would be an entire guide in and of itself and unfortunately I have neither the time nor the artistic ability to make such a guide, at least for now.

What this chapter WILL do, is examine the key aspects of the artistic process as well as the many techniques you can apply to your drawings to create a specific effect for your reader.
