Thumbnails are an essential first step to the drawing process. By quickly sketching out your pages, **you can determine the key aspects of the page as well as the elements that do and don’t work**.

It’s important to remember that thumbnails are experimental in nature. You’ll be throwing out a lot of your designs as you go along so do yourself a favour and **don’t spend an hour filling in all the details of your thumbnails**. Save that hard work for the penciling stage.
