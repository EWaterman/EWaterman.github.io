So now you’ve written up your solicitation, where do you post it?

Here’s a list of some of the common online places comic creators go to find a team:


- [Digital Webbing](http://www.digitalwebbing.com/forums/) - Active forums for writers, artists, letterers and other creators. FANTASTIC for finding collaborators.

- [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/) - Massive collection of artists. Also has writers though they are less common.

- [Comic Book Collabs SubReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComicBookCollabs/) - Reddit forums for finding collaborators. This is where I found my artist for More Than Men. They post anthologies here too!

- [Comic Book Hour](http://comicbookhour.com/forum) - Similar to deviant art, but specific to comics. Has a section dedicated to finding comic partners.

- [ZWOL](http://www.zwol.org/forum) - An older comic forum with a section where you can post solicitations for collaborators.

- [Connecting Comic Book Writers and Artists](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Connecting.Comic.Book.Writers.and.Artists/) - Highly active Facebook group for finding collaborators.

- [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) - Not specific to comics but has a large list of illustrators and graphic designers.


If you’re looking for direct, in person hiring you have a few options:

- **Go to comic conventions.** Conventions are a great way to make connections with both new and established creators. Different conventions have different purposes. Some are specific to comics while others are general “fan expos”. Know what the purpose of each convention is to know what kinds of people you should expect to see.

- **Find local comic communities.** Depending on how large your city is, you may have a small local comic community. ([Like my local comics society, Cloudscape!](http://cloudscapecomics.com)) You can usually find these communities through google, or by checking for public facebook groups and events like drink and draws or comic jams. You can also ask at your local art gallery. If your area doesn’t have a community, consider creating one!
