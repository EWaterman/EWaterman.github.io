Your solicitation will be your first point of contact with potential collaborators so it’s important to leave a good impression. When in doubt be professional. You never know who’s watching.

Every comic solicitation should include the following:

- **Who you are.** (Writer, artist, publisher…)

- **Who you’re looking for.** (Writer, artist, publisher…)

- **What your product is.** If it’s a comic, how many pages is it?

- **What your timeline is.** When does the work need to start and when must it be completed?

- **What the pay rate is.** Is it paid work? Are you paying per page or is it percentage based? How much? 

- **A logline.** Give a one line hook to get people interested in your story

- **A summary or longer pitch.** Don’t be vague! Tell us what makes your project awesome.

- **What your plans are for the work.** Are you planning on launching a Kickstarter, pitching to publishers or is it just a personal project?

- **What your progress is so far.** Is it just an idea or have you written the whole script already? (That second option is far more appealing.)

- **Is there a specific style you’re looking for?** If so, provide examples.

- **DO NOT try and flatter yourself.** Including things like “My comic is awesome!” or “It’ll make lots of money!” just makes you seem ignorant. Let your work speak for itself. If your story is good, people will be interested.
