Now that you're finally ready to start hiring your art team, it's time to write and submit your pitch!

This is usually one of the scariest parts of the process for me as it's the first time I open my stories up to the outside world, even if it's just to other artists. Don't worry too much though. You haven't committed to anything yet, so don't feel you need to have every single detail nailed down at this point.

That said, your solicitation will be your first point of contact with potential collaborators, so it’s important to leave a good impression. When in doubt, be professional. You never know who’s watching.

Every comic solicitation should include the following information:

- **Who you are.** (Writer, artist, editor, publisher…)

- **Who you’re looking for.** (Writer, artist, editor, publisher…)

- **What your product is.** If it’s a comic, how many pages is it? How many issues/volumes?

- **What your timeline is.** When does the work need to start and when must it be completed?

- **What the pay rate is.** Is it paid work? Are you paying per page or is it percentage based? How much? 

- **A logline.** Give a one line hook to get people interested in your story

- **A summary or longer pitch.** Don’t be vague! Tell us what makes your project awesome.

- **What your plans are for the work.** Are you planning on launching a Kickstarter, pitching to publishers or is it just a personal project?

- **What your progress is so far.** Is it just an idea or have you written the whole script already? (That second option is far more appealing to publishers and artists.)

- **Is there a specific style you’re looking for?** If so, provide examples.

- **DO NOT try and flatter yourself.** Including things like “My comic is awesome!” or “It’ll make lots of money!” just makes you seem ignorant. Let your work speak for itself. If your story is good, people will be interested.

- You can however **mention previous experience in the industry.** Having previous work that people can reference is a good way of showing your credibility. Don't go overboard however. Your focus should be on the story you're trying to produce, and your pitch should be good enough to stand on its own, independent from your prior achievements.
