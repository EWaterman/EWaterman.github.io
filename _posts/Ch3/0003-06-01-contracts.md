<hr><br>

Publishers will almost certainly provide their own contracts (if they don’t, be weary) but if you’re self publishing, you’ll be handling it yourself.

If you’re collaborating with a team on a project, you’re going to want a contract, especially if it’s long term. **People will naturally forget things that were agreed upon so it’s a good idea to have written and signed information down when that happens.** It also help clear up any confusion at the start of projects.

**<u>MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:</u>** I’m not a lawyer! As always, my suggestions here are just that: suggestions. When in doubt, talk to a professional.

With that said, I like to make sure my contract answers the following questions:

- **Who is responsible for creating each element of the property?** Who’s doing the writing, the pencils, the inks etc...

- **What does the creation of each element entail?** Specify the steps you expect to see before a page is deemed complete (thumbnails, pencils, inks). Make sure to include how many edit requests you’re entitled to at each step.

- **What is the amount of work to be done before the contract is complete?** Generally this is the number of pages for your comic but it doesn’t have to be.

- **How is the copyright for the property going to be distributed between each creator?** Decide who retains the rights to things like the original art, characters, the story... 

- **How will the revenue be distributed between each creator?** Indicate whether your collaborator will be receiving a percentage of sales or a fixed rate and what that amount is.

- **How often will payment will be awarded?** If you’re hiring percentage, decide how many times per year you’ll be paying out to your collaborators. If you’re hiring fixed rate, are you paying 50% in advance, per x complete pages, one bulk sum at the end…

- **What is your method of payment?** I’ve always used Paypal but there are other options out there.

- **What happens if payment is not granted?** This is to reassure your team members that you won’t hang them out to dry. Usually they retain the complete rights to their work until payment is awarded.

- **Who has right to sell the work?** Decide if your team members will be able to sell their own copies or if you or someone else will be handling the sales.

- **What are your deadlines?** When does the project have to be completed? How many pages should be done per week?

- **How will you show attribution for the work?** This usually entails something like adding the artist's name to any of their work you post online.

- **What countries laws apply to the contract?** If your contract is between people of different countries you have to explicitly establish which countries laws you want to apply.

- **Who has decision making authority for the property?** Someone has to have the final say on how the pages will look. Generally this is the one doing the hiring.

- **What are the means of terminating the contract?** Explain what happens if the contract is not completed as agreed upon. How will payment be awarded? Who retains rights?

- **How will privacy be handled?** If you want to avoid spoilers, add a non-disclosure section to make sure they don’t post certain work publicly.

Here are a few example templates for collaboration contracts:

It’s important to note that **long-distance contracts, especially international ones, are hard to enforce**. If your artist in Madagascar decides take your art and run… there isn’t a whole lot you can do. Ultimately it’s important to remember that a contract is only as good as the people signing it. As long as you have a reliable, trustworthy team (Check up on their previous projects!) then odds are you won’t have a problem.
