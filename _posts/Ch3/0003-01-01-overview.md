Unless you’re doing everything yourself, you’re going to have to put together a team to bring your comic to life. (If you are doing everything yourself, you’re awesome! You can just jump ahead to the [next chapter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/Ch4/0004-01-01-overview.md %}).)

Not to put on the pressure or anything but **how well your team works together will mean the success or failure of your comic**. Make sure you put effort into assembling a strong, cohesive group.

An important thing to note is that **you don’t have to be done with your script before you start looking for collaborators.** It could take a month or longer to find the right team and once you do there will still be lots of preliminary work to get done before you start work on the actual comic.

That said, make sure you've got your schedule well organized. You don't want to have your team waiting for pages to draw while you're still scrambling to get the script done. You don't need to put that kind of pressure on yourself. Like everything, it's a balancing act but as long as you're comfortable with your plan you'll be just fine.
