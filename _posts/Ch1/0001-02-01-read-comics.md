This may go without saying, but **if you want to write good comics you have to understand the medium**. One of the best ways to do that is to read other comics!

Without an understanding of what gets readers excited to go out and buy that next issue of their favourite comic, your stories won't have the heart they need to be truly great.

Unfortunately, I can’t give you a magic list of comics that you’re going to love, simply because no one comic is adored by every single person who reads it. The comics I read may not be the ones you’d want to pick up.

So I leave it to you.

Do some research: ask your friends what they like to read, look online for the top comics of all time (and make sure to check out a bunch of different genres), hit up your local comic shop or library... Dive deep into the world of comics, and discover the stories that YOU love to read. Read, read and read some more because **you will only truly be able to spark a passion for your story in someone else if you have first found that passion within yourself**.
