I know you're eager to get right into the meat of things but if it wasn't obvious from the length of this guide, **comics are complicated**. A lot of work goes into getting them right, so before we start getting into the how-tos, I want to lay a bit of ground work.

This section will cover some personal and organizational lessons you might want to consider, as well as a few things I wish I had thought about before I started making comics.
