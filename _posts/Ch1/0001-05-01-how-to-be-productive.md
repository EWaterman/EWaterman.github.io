Being productive is massively important. If you’re not putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard… or drawing tablet) you’re not going to finish your story. 

I could write a whole book about being productive (and maybe I will one day) but for now here are a few tips to help you stay productive:

- **Build a schedule and stick to it.** If you have designated writing time, your brain will be more likely to stay focused on writing during that time period.

- Similarly, **have a designated work spot.** If you work in the same place you sleep and watch cat videos, you’re going to have trouble staying focused on your work. If you take a break, leave your work spot.

- **Block out access to distractions.** Unplug your TV, disconnect from the internet, move your other work out of the room… There are many ways to force yourself to stay on task. You could even download an app blocker like [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) that shuts you out from certain programs temporarily while you work.

- **Create a to-do list and break your project into workable chunks.** Making a comic can seem like a daunting task. By breaking things down into workable chunks (ink page 1, apply to Marvel, sort out budget...) you can make sure you’re always progressing towards your goal. Some digital lists that you can get on your phone and computer are [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/), [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) or 9Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) (or [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) if you have mac or iPhone). If you’re looking for a more fun approach, try turning your list into a real life role playing game with [Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/front).

- Don’t just give yourself one big deadline, **give your TODO items deadlines.** Deadlines help put the pressure on yourself to actually start working on your project. By setting a specific done date for each task, you can pace yourself throughout the entire process, making sure you are setup to be constantly progressing.

- **Be accountable to someone.** It’s easy to justify to yourself that you can take a week off from writing but when that week turns into a month, you have yourself a problem. Whether it be your mom, your friend, your Twitter followers or a fellow writer, make sure someone other than you knows you’re trying to make a comic. By forcing yourself to give daily or weekly updates to someone about your progress, you’ll feel more obligated to finish your work.
