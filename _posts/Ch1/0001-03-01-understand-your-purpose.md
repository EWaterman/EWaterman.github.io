Whether it be to make the reader laugh, to make them fall in love or just to get your thoughts out of your head, **every single story has a purpose.** 

When I say purpose, I’m not talking about concepts like plot and genre. Those are just a part of what makes up the purpose. The purpose itself is what your story is setting out to achieve.

Before you start writing your comic I want you to ask yourself: **What do I want people to gain from reading my story?**

I ask this because **readers have a purpose too.** Maybe they want to cry, maybe they want to be scared, maybe they want to be asked hard questions. By knowing your purpose you’ll be able to determine the readers who will be most passionate about what your story has to offer.

> Woah there, I haven’t even started and you’re already talking about my "readers"!

Yeah I know, your comic may still be a long way from completion but it’s purpose is something you have to understand from the outset if you want to get it right.

> But my book doesn’t have a purpose, it’s for everyone!

First off, it’s not your choice whether or not to have a purpose. **Every story has a purpose. All you can do is choose what that purpose is.** If you don’t clearly identify your purpose, you risk alienating your readers and ultimately make your comic appeal to no one.

Secondly, **there is absolutely no way that your story will appeal to every type of comic reader.** This goes back to readers having a specific purpose as well. When marketing your story, **you’re way better off targeting the audience that matches your specific purpose.** Sure it may be a smaller audience but it will be a far more passionate one. Those are the kinds of people who will share your story around and the people who will ultimately buy book when it comes to market.

Every good story has a clear, attainable purpose, so what’s yours?
