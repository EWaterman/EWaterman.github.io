The future of your comic depends on who is going to publish it so it's important to put effort into your submissions. Here are a few short tips on how to be successful when pitching your comic.

- **Research the publisher.** Don't just blindly submit to every publisher. Know each one's guidelines and what kind of content they produce. Find the publishers that will be most interested in your work and target those. Similarly...

- **Personalize your pitch.** Publishers receive a ton of submissions so "Dear <insert publisher name here>" pitches won't stand out among the crowd. Do the heavy lifting for them and include with your submission your reasons for why they'd want to produce your work. What's it similar to? What audience does it appeal to?

- **Give them something to look at.** Whether it's character designs or the entire completed comic, you should include at least some visual piece to go with your pitch. This is mainly to help you stand out as most publishers will get bored if all you provide is a script. That said, some publishers wish to receive very specific things so again make sure to read their guidelines before submitting.
