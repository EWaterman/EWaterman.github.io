Now that your comic is well under way and everyone knows about it, it's time to start thinking about who's going to produce it!

Are you going to look for a publisher or will you step into the world of self publishing?

The answer to that question is an important one, as it'll determine the kind of work that will be in store for you later on.

We'll cover both options in this section so hopefully by the end you'll have a better idea of how you want to get your comic out to the world!
