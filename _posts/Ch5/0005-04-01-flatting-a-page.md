The role of a comic flatter is to prepare inked pages to be coloured. Essentially it boils down to providing a quick and easy way to colour specific regions of a page.

Flatting can often be a tedious step in the colouring process. Not everyone does it but if youâ€™re going for a colour-in-the-lines art style (as opposed to something more natural like watercolours), **flatting will ultimately save you a ton of time and help keep your colours looking tight**.

Here are some beginner tutorials to get you started on flatting:
