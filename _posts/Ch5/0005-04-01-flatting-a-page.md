The role of a comic flatter is to prepare inked pages to be coloured. Some colourists flat their own pages, some hire their own flatters, and some don't flat their pages at all.

> Wait... what's a flatter?

A flatter works before the colourist, separating the elements of each comic page into "flat" colours. This makes it easy for a colourist to digitally colour specific regions of a page since they can now just use the magic wand tool to quickly select and edit each individual colour.

Flatting can often be a tedious step in the colouring process. Not everyone does it, but if youâ€™re going for a colour-in-the-lines art style (as opposed to something more natural like watercolours), **flatting will ultimately save you a ton of time, and help keep your colours looking tight**.

Here are some beginner tutorials to get you started on flatting:
