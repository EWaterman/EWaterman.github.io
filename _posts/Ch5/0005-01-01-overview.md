**Colours are the first thing anyone notices when they look at a page.** They’re also very easy to get wrong.

Just like drawing, I’m NOT going to teach you how to colour. What I WILL do, is show you the tools and techniques you can use to maximize what you can get from your colours.

### Colouring Terminology

- **Hue:** The actual colour itself. Going from red to blue is a change in hue.

- **Saturation:** How much gray is in the colour. The higher the saturation, the more "pure" and intense the colour. A saturation of zero is completely greytone.

- **Brightness/Luminosity:** Related to saturation, but about how bright the colour is. A brightness of zero is black.

- **Flats:** Breaking each segment of a page/panel into a single colour with no rendering. Done in advance of rendering to speed up the process (see the section on flatting) but can also be used stylistically in the final art.

- **Rendering:** Varying hue, saturation and brightness within segments to add more detail to colours.

- **Colour Hold:** Changing black line art to a non black colour. Often used for style but can also be used to show atmospheric perspective (more on that later). Check out Nathan Fairburn's [quick tutorial on how to to do colour holds](http://nathanfairbairn.tumblr.com/post/177262143624/color-holds).
