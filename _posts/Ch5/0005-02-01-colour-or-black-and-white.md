Contrary to common belief, **modern day comics don’t have to be in colour to be “good”**. Like everything, there are tradeoffs to consider which should influence your decision.

Often times, black and white is seen in darker, more gritty comics but this is not always the case. The action comedy [Scott Pilgrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim) had major success in black and white (though a colour version was later released).

Here are a few reasons why you should consider going with black and white:

- **Black and white can be used to put extra emphasis on the linework.** Colours give the reader a lot to absorb and thus take attention away from the art itself. In colourless comics, the shapes and patterns of the linework are front and center. This can be used to emphasize the body language of characters by really showing the curves of the body. Look at [this page](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/62/c5/ee62c56e48d429c6f978c8722f77f0ae.jpg) (NSFW) from Sin City. Patterns and leading lines become far more prominent in black and white. The intense direction we get from [this page](http://ivanredi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Frank-Miller-Sin-City.jpg) just wouldn’t be as impactful in colour.

- **Black and white comics can have more prominent lighting and shading.** With black and white you can really up the contrast in your pages. This works similarly to the previous point as it can really show off the shapes of things. It can also amplify the emotions of a character or scene. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zND4iSx1P3E) by Strip Panel Naked which explains this point in depth.

- **The art can be melded together.** Without colour, page depth becomes less prominent. The foreground and background start to blend together into a single layer, becoming one, larger image. This results in more abstract or stylized environments. This is super useful when creating more poetic or surreal stories like [Epileptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_(comics)).
