You might be wondering why I put this chapter before publication and crowdfunding. I did so because I believe that it’s crucial to **start developing an audience for your comic before you launch it**.

One of the biggest mistakes I see first time creators make is that they assume that their audience will come to them. While there are some cases where a webcomic takes off out of seemingly nowhere, these are the minority and should not be your expectation going into your project. The vast majority of the time, **if you want your comic to be noticed, you’re going to have to seek out your audience yourself**.

This is huge when it comes to crowdfunding comics. You can’t just launch a cool looking Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign for your comic and expect backers to come sailing in. Unless you’re extremely lucky or are doing exceptionally well already, **you’re not going to be getting a reliable number of backers through random discovery**.

Even if you plan on publishing through the traditional route, having a pre-existing audience will go a long way to helping you out. **A lot of publishers will be far more willing to pick up your comic if you can show there is a demand for it.** After all, their goal is to publish comics that are going to be successful. What better way to show that than having a whole crowd of people yelling “Take my money!” at your comic?

> Okay so how exactly do I start gathering a following for my comic?

Marketing, marketing, marketing.

At its core, **marketing is all about building and maintaining an audience for your product**.

In this chapter, we’re going to cover a whole bunch of different approaches (and there are a TON of approaches) you can take to get people supporting your comic.

Before we get into it though, it’s important to know that regardless of how good your marketing campaign is, **the best selling point of any product is quality**.

No matter how nice you dress up your comic, if the art and story aren’t up to snuff, you’re not going to get a strong following for it.

Before you start worrying about how to market the story to potential publishers or how to get the most sales out of your Kickstarter campaign, you have to first make sure that you’re producing really solid content for people to enjoy.
