						Ten years ago the US government found a way to manufacture super powers but the high cost of production meant that only the <b>RICH</b> could afford the procedure.
						<b>MORE THAN MEN</b> is the story of the League: the last remaining superhero team in America.
						Once loved and respected, the heroes now struggle to stay relevant in a world that has reduced their abilities to the mundane.
						But as tensions begin to rise between the powered and non-powered communities, our heroes will once again see themselves thrust into the spotlight, just not in the way they expect...
